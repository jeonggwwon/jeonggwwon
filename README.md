# 👋 Hi, I'm Gyowon

### Backend Engineer building **AI-integrated web services**
with a focus on **reliability, performance, and clear responsibility separation**.

I design systems by iterating on **constraints and trade-offs observed across previous projects** —  
especially around **latency**, **scalability**, and **response reliability**.

I mainly work with **Spring Boot** and **FastAPI**,  
and I integrate AI components in a **controlled, performance-aware, and predictable way**  
rather than relying on fully autonomous AI flows.

I am a Computer Science graduate-to-be, and most of the projects below were built
as team-based academic or capstone projects with production-oriented constraints.

## 🛠️ What I Do
- 🧩 Design backend systems with **clear responsibility boundaries**
- 🔐 Build secure authentication flows using **JWT & OAuth2**
- 🤖 Integrate **LLM-based AI agents** into production-oriented services
- 🔄 Build real-time interaction servers using **WebSocket**
- ⚡ Reduce latency and unnecessary load through **caching strategies**
- 🚀 Deploy and operate **multi-service environments** using Docker and AWS

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI)
- **Security & Auth**: Spring Security, JWT (Access / Refresh), OAuth2 (Kakao)
- **AI Integration**: LLM-based agents (OpenAI API)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Realtime**: WebSocket
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, AWS EC2, RDS, S3

---

## 🧠 How I Think
- I don’t try to directly fix every limitation I encounter.
  Instead, I pay attention to **where and why certain approaches break down**,
  even in areas outside my immediate responsibility.
- These observations become **decision-making context** in later projects,
  especially when choosing between simpler approaches and more complex ones.
- I believe technical choices should be driven by
  **problem scale, interaction patterns, and operational constraints**,
  not by technology trends alone.
- For AI integration, I prefer designs where behavior is
  **bounded, explainable, and predictable**,
  with clear fallback paths for latency, cache misses, or partial failures.

## 📂 Projects

### 🧓 T-Aging — AI Agent-based Kiosk & Mobile Service
🔗 [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/T-Aging)  
📆 *2025.09 – 2025.12*

**Role**: Backend / Infrastructure  
**Tech**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, FastAPI, WebSocket, RabbitMQ, MySQL, Redis, Docker, AWS

**Summary**  
Designed the overall system architecture for a real-time kiosk environment,  
including separated **local / central databases**, session management, AI integration,  
caching strategies, and asynchronous data synchronization.

**Highlights**
- 🧑‍💻 Designed per-user WebSocket sessions to manage conversational state and ordering flow
- 🗄️ Introduced a **two-layer caching strategy** with distinct responsibilities  
  - **L1**: In-memory TTL cache for session-scoped menu snapshots (DB load reduction)  
  - **L2**: Redis cache for FAQ & intent-level responses (LLM call reduction)
- ⚡ Applied **fuzzy matching** for short kiosk queries to improve cache hit rates and response time
- 📊 Evaluated multiple LLM models under latency & availability constraints and selected **GPT-4o**
- 🔀 Defined data ownership boundaries between local (kiosk) and central (mobile) databases
- 📬 Built an **event-driven order synchronization pipeline** using RabbitMQ
